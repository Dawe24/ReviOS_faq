# Before and while installing ReviOS

## What is the difference between the versions? What to choose?

As of this moment (2022-02-18), there are 3 versions of ReviOS that are supported: `22.02`, `21.01` and `1709`. No other versions are supported.

Usually every other released version is based on the same Windows version, with newer updates and tweaks. Like in odd numbered months, Windows 10, in even numbered months Windows 11.

If you are looking for a version:

- more gaming, less latency and less bloatware oriented, choose `1709`
- more compatible with latest programs, choose `22.02` or `22.01`

**_Faceit only works on 22.02 and 22.01 versions._** [Details below](#which-version-can-i-use-faceit-faceit-is-not-working).

## Which version do I need for Faceit?

As of this moment (2022-02-18), Faceit only works on the `22.02` and `22.01` versions.

If you are using one of these versions, and still cannot use Faceit, since the release of that version probably another update was released by Microsoft, which is required by Faceit. New build of ReviOS will be released soon.
