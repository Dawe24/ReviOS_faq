# Advice before doing anything

Before using this FAQ, please do your own research, look around on the [ReviOS website](https://www.revi.cc/), there specifically in the [Changelogs](https://www.revi.cc/revios/download/changelog), the [Post-install](https://www.revi.cc/revios/post-install) guide and the [Workspace](https://www.revi.cc/revios/workspace) and on [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/962y4pU).

Also use Google (or the search engine of your choice), especially with not ReviOS related questions.
