## Installation stoped with an error

First, verify the ISO. You can find the checksums [here](https://www.revi.cc/revios/download/verify). And if you use Rufus, switch to Ventoy. Help in the [installation guide](install.md).

If the installation needs a driver, please refer the [installation tutorial](install.md#missing-drivers).
