## Internet/sound/touchpad/who knows what else... not working
Download the drivers from the manufacturer's website.

If you can't do that, for example you don't have internet driver, download [Snappy Driver Installer](https://sdi-tool.org/) Full. It will download all the drivers they have, about 21 GB. If you have internet access and you need to download other drivers, just choose the Lite version, it will scan your hardware, and only download the drivers you need.
