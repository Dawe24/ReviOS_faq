# Advice before doing anything

Before using this FAQ, please do your own research, look around on the [ReviOS website](https://www.revi.cc/), there specifically in the [Changelogs](https://www.revi.cc/revios/download/changelog), the [Post-install](https://www.revi.cc/revios/post-install) guide and the [Workspace](https://www.revi.cc/revios/workspace) and on [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/962y4pU).

Also use Google (or the search engine of your choice), especially with not ReviOS related questions.

You can find here things that are on the ReviOS website, because people are dumb, and going to ask it anyway.
