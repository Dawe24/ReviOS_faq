**Before using this faq, please do your own research, look around on the *Revi* site (https://www.revi.cc/), there specifically the *Post-install* (https://www.revi.cc/revios/post-install) configurations/installations and the *Workspace* (https://www.revi.cc/revios/workspace) for fixes, enable and disable configurations. Also use Google (or the search engine of your choice), especially with not Revi related questions. You can find here things that are on the Revi website, but people are dumb, and going to ask it anyway.**

ReviOS frequently asked questions
**What's the difference between the versions? What to choose?**
> As of this moment (2021-07-17), there are 3 versions of ReviOS that are supported: 1709, 20H2 and 21H1. No other versions are supported.
> If you are looking for a version:
> - more gaming, less latency and less bloatware oriented, choose 1709
> - more compatible with latest programs, choose 21H1
> Between these 2 is 20H2, which is supports almost everything 21H1 (e.g. Adobe products) but has better mouse input, less latency.
> ***Faceit only works on 21H1.***

> Download the drivers from the manufacturer's website.
> If you can't do that, for example you don't have internet driver, somehow download [Snappy Driver Installer](https://sdi-tool.org/) Full. It will download all the drivers they have, about 21 GB. If you have internet access and you need to download other drivers, just choose the Lite version, it will scan your hardware, and only download the drivers you need.
